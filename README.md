## To Run:
```
mvn package
```
then
```
java -jar target/ratingCalc-0.1.0.jar
```
## To use:

You will be prompted for your PDGA number.  
Next you are prompted to enter any new rounds that you have played since the last update.

The resulting rating may be wrong by 1-2 points as it is sometimes difficult to discern the PDGA's calculations exactly.
